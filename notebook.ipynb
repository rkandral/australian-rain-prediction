    "### Data Source\n",
    "The data used in this project was downloaded from the Kaggle dataset titled [Rain in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package), which itself was originally sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's [Daily Weather Observations](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/). Additional weather metrics for Australia can be found within the bureau's [Climate Data Online](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) web app.\n",

    "### Business Problem\n",
    "Weather, and humankind's ability to accurately predict it, plays a critical role in many aspects of life. From farmers growing crops to a family planning a weekend vacation to logistical decision making within airlines, rain in particular is highly influential regarding plans. In some instances, the impact of rain can have large financial consequences. As a result, there is a strong interest from a plethora of stakeholders in the ability to accurately forecast rain. The goal of this project is to use the available data to create a next-day prediction model for whether or not it will rain. Such a model could be utilized in a weather app for the benefit of the public at large. "
